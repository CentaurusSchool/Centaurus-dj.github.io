## What is this repository

This repository is a github-only repo as it's required in order to launch
a Profile GitHub-Pages environment.
It has 2 folders, the [`old`](https://github.com/centaurus-dj/centaurus-dj.github.io/tree/master/old/) folder and the [`new`](https://github.com/centaurus-dj/centaurus-dj.github.io/tree/master/new/) folder.
One for the old website root - still accessable - and one for the new website root.
It has been then added an [index.html](https://github.com/centaurus-dj/centaurus-dj.github.io/tree/master/index.html) file which automatically redirects to the new website.
